INSTRUCTIONS
------------

This README describes the running of RAMS version 4.4
for the test run under Linux. Although the execution under the various 
Unix versions should be the same, there may be slight differences in 
some of the system commands.

Note that this run is configured as a very small run to make it easy 
to run as a test. It is NOT intended to serve as a default configuration
for necessarily any of the namelist settings. Please see the namelist 
documentation for further guidance.




1) Download the Unix gzipped tar file...

     rams-test-4.4.tar.gz

   from the web address...

     http://bridge.atmet.org/rams-test/rams-4.4

2) Unpack the contents of the tar file in your rams root directory...

     tar -xzvf rams-test-4.4.tar.gz
 
   Go to the test-rams44 directory, which will serve as the working directory 
   for this run and check its contents...
  
     cd test-rams44
     ls -l
     
   This should produce the following...
  
     README_RAMS_TEST   this file  
     data/              test run initialization data
     geodata/           contains geophysical surface data
     VTABLE             VTABLE for the test run
     RAMSIN-makesfc     RAMSIN files for the test run
     RAMSIN-makevfile   RAMSIN files for the test run
     RAMSIN-initial     RAMSIN files for the test run
     isan/              location for varaible initialization file storage
     sfc/               location for surface file storage
     sst/               location for sea surface temperature file storage
     hist/              location for history file storage
     anal/              location for analysis file storage
     s44                script to assist in copying executables to cluster nodes
     

   All of the directories except the "data" and "geodata" directories are empty 
   and are used for rams output. The data directory contains the gridded and 
   observation data used to create the isan files for input into the 
   simulation. The geodata directory contains the geophysical data used 
   for the test run. Geophysical data for other regions is available from...
  
     http://www.atmet.com/html/data.shtml
  
3) Make sure that the RAMS v4.4 executable is compiled as described in the 
   installation README file. To use the executables, I have usually found it 
   best to make symbolic links in the working directory
     
     ln -s rams-executable-name rams44
     
   On some machines, you may need to make a physical copy of the executables in
   your working directory, ie...
     
     cp rams-executable-name rams44

   Note here that "rams-executable-name" is the actual file name of 
   the executable. For example, /home/rams/bin/rams-4.4  or 
   /home/rams/bin/rams-4.4-opt. The link  or copy will simply be 
   called "rams44" in your working directory.
  
   If you do make copies of the executables in your working directory, 
   don't forget to update these when you remake in the bin directory. Otherwise,
   your changes will not appear in your simulations.

4) To run the test simulation...

   To run the executables, there are two possible command line methods to use.
   
      - If you compiled for a sequential executable (non-parallel) by not defining
         -DRAMS_MPI when you compiled, then you can simply give the name of the 
         link/copied executable in the working directory. 
         In this case, "./rams44" would work.
         
      - On some machines, if you created the executable with the MPI libraries,
         you may have to run even a sequential run using the "mpirun" command.
         In this case, you would have to use: 
         "/usr/local/mpich/bin/mpirun -np 1 rams44" to run a non-parallel job.
         Obviously, you will need to find the location of the correct mpirun 
         executable for your installation.
         
   For the following examples, I will assume the simpler command line.
   

   Step 1: Make the surface files. This will create intermediate files of 
           topography, land use, and sst that will be used by RAMS as 
           long as your grids do not change.
  
          To execute:
          
          ./rams44 -f RAMSIN-makesfc
          
  
          This should produce the surface files...
  
            sfc/sfc-S-g1.vfm
            sfc/sfc-S-g2.vfm
       
            sst/sst-S-0000-01-16-120000-g1.vfm
            sst/sst-S-0000-02-15-000000-g1.vfm

            sst/sst-S-0000-08-16-120000-g1.vfm
            sst/sst-S-0000-09-16-000000-g1.vfm
            sst/sst-S-0000-10-16-120000-g1.vfm
            sst/sst-S-0000-11-16-000000-g1.vfm

            sst/sst-S-0000-12-16-120000-g2.vfm
     
         The surface files created on our Linux machine are posted at...
  
            http://bridge.atmet.org/rams-test/rams-4.4/results/sfc.tar.gz
            http://bridge.atmet.org/rams-test/rams-4.4/results/sst.tar.gz
  
         and the output listing at...
  
            http://bridge.atmet.org/rams-test/rams-4.4/results/rams-makesfc.lis
  
         if you wish to compare your output with ours.
  
   Step 2. Make the variable initialization files. These are files that contain the
           analyzed data which are used for RAMS initial conditions, boundary 
           conditions, and four-dimensional data assimilation. 
   
           To execute:
           
           ./rams44 -f RAMSIN-makevfile
  
           This should produce the isan files...
    
               isan/a-V-2000-07-30-120000-g1.vfm
               isan/a-V-2000-07-30-120000-g2.vfm
               isan/a-V-2000-07-30-120000.tag
               isan/a-V-2000-07-30-180000-g1.vfm
               isan/a-V-2000-07-30-180000-g2.vfm
               isan/a-V-2000-07-30-180000.tag
               isan/a-V-2000-07-31-000000-g1.vfm
               isan/a-V-2000-07-31-000000-g2.vfm
               isan/a-V-2000-07-31-000000.tag
               isan/a-V-2000-07-31-060000-g1.vfm
               isan/a-V-2000-07-31-060000-g2.vfm
               isan/a-V-2000-07-31-060000.tag
               isan/a-V-2000-07-31-120000-g1.vfm
               isan/a-V-2000-07-31-120000-g2.vfm
               isan/a-V-2000-07-31-120000.tag
     
           The isan files created on our Linux machine are posted at...
  
            http://bridge.atmet.org/rams-test/rams-4.4/results/isan.tar.gz

           and the output listing at...
  
            http://bridge.atmet.org/rams-test/rams-4.4/results/rams-makevfile.lis
  
  
  Step 3. Run the simulation (in non-parallel, sequential mode):
  
            To execute:
               
            ./rams44 -f RAMSIN-initial
  
            This should produce the history and analysis files...

            Note the different analysis filename prefixes refer to:
            
               A   standard analysis file
               L   lite analysis file
               M   standard average analysis file
               B   lite average analysis file
               
            Note also that the L, M, and B files will depend on your application
            and may not be required for any specific run.
            
            The output analysis and history files created on our Linux machine
            are posted at...

            and the output listings at...
           
               http://bridge.atmet.org/rams-test/rams-4.4/results/rams-initial.lis-np1
               http://bridge.atmet.org/rams-test/rams-4.4/results/rams-initial.lis-np4
            
            where the "-np1" is from a single processor sequential run and 
            the "-np4" is from a four processor parallel run.
  
  
    
  Step 3a. Run the simulation in parallel:   
    
    
            If you compiled in parallel and have a parallel machine to use, 
            you can repeat the run using multiple processors. Note that the 
            MAKESFC or MAKEVFILE executions do not run in parallel.
            
            The actual technique to run in parallel will vary depending
            on your platform. We have found that there are mostly two ways
            to execute:
            
            1) If you are running on a shared-memory machine using the 
               manufacturer's version of MPI, you will usually need to 
               consult their documentation. Typically, the command line 
               would be:
               
               mpirun -np 4 rams44 -f RAMSIN-initial
               
               where -np specifies the number of processes (usually equal to
               the number of processors) that you wish to run.
               
            2) If you are running the MPICH software from Argonne National 
               Laboratory (http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich/index.html)
               on a cluster or other system, there is way to configure it to
               also be able to use the -np option. Consult the MPICH 
               documentation if you wish to do this. However, we have 
               usually found it more flexible to use a "p4pg" file to 
               specify exactly which machines and executables we want to use.
    
               Following is an example of the p4pg file, which we frequently 
               call a "machs" file. It containing one line for the master 
               processor, then additional lines for each compute node. Each 
               line contains the machine name, the number of processes to 
               start on the machine, and the full path to the executable 
               (as it will be seen from the individual machine).
    
                  rock  0 /r1/rams/test-rams44/rams44
                  fire  1 /home/rams/bin/43
                  air   2 /home/rams/bin/43
                  earth 2 /home/rams/bin/43    
    
               where the 0 indicates the master node. You will then need to 
               copy the executable to the location and names on the nodes as 
               specified in this "machs" file. (I won't get into NFS 
               options here.) You then use the following command:
    
               mpirun -p4pg machs rams44 -f RAMSIN-initial
 
               Of course, this assumes that the mpirun executable location is 
               in your Unix/Linux $PATH variable.
               
               The same history and analysis files as listed for the non-parallel
               run should be created.
               
               A small script "s44", or "send rams44" has been included in the 
               test directory to assist in copying the RAMS executable to the compute 
               nodes. It WILL need to be modified for your installation.
               
               And finally, this discussion has assumed that the MPICH software
               and cluster networking has been configured properly. Ahh, a 
               document for another day....
               
               
Good Luck!
