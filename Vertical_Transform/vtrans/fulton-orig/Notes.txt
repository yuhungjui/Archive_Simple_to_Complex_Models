File Notes.txt for directory vtrans:  Vertical Normal Mode Transforms

Mon Feb 22 16:55:13 EST 1999
----------------------------
Dug up old code for vtrans.  Converted to lower case, set up Makefile, etc.  
Converted to double precision and checked routine gaussl.

----------------------------
Did some minimal updates of Makefile and README.txt to reflect the current
state of the code.  In particular, it doesn't run, since it references the
adaptive quadrature routine "adquad" (an old NCAR routine) which I don't have.
This could be replaced by something equivalent but I haven't done so yet.

This directory is now under revision control using Mercurial (hg).
Updated comments in vtrans.f (capitalization of T and R, spelling errors).
