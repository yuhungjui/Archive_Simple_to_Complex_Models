This directory contains software for vertical transforms as described in 

     Fulton, S. R. and W. H. Schubert, 1985:  Vertical Normal Mode Transforms:
     Theory and Application.  Monthly Weather Review, vol. 113, pp. 647-658.

    **filename**    ***** contents *****
     vtrans.for     Vertical transform package
     vtrans.dri     Driver program for use with data cards/files
     vtrans.tes     Sample job file (used to produce a test run)
     vtrans.job     Sample job file (used to produce results for paper above)
     cgamma.for     Vertical structure functions for constant gamma
     cgamma.fod     Double precision version of  cgamma.for

Use of the various routines is fully explained in their comments.  
Note that the job files use CRAY COS statements; I have not reworked this
for running under UNIX systems yet.  Also, note that the EISPACK routine 
rsg  (not included) is required to run  vtrans.  The code should run; 
I will try to help out if there are problems, but do not have time to 
fully support this package.  Direct comments/questions to me:
