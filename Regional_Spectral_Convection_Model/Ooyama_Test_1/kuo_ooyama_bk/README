This model implements Ooyama(1990) thermodynamics
scheme with double spectral method.
X-direction: Fourier Galerkin method.
Z-direction: Chebyshev Tau method.
Time integration scheme: 4th order Runge-Kutta method.
The program language used in this model is Fortran 77.

-------------------------------------------------
This model could run all the 2-D examples given 
in this paper.
ex.1) Dry hydrostatic adjustment experiment.
     (Hydrostatic adjustment by acoustic wave.)
ex.2) Rising dry bubble in a hydrostatic atmosphere.
ex.3) Rising moist bubble in a hydrostatic atmosphere.
ex.4) Condensation with a specified tilt updraft.

-------------------------------------------------
The model is located at the directory -- kuo_ooyama_bk
This directory contains:
(A) Files
1) main.f        <--  The main reconv model code
2) cfftlib.f     <--  Spectral method subroutines
3) c2o.f         <--  The include file
4) run           <--  The execution file
5) README        <--  The file you are reading now.
                      The description of the model.

(B) Directories
1) dataout       <--  The output files located
2) plot_program  <--  The matlab program for drawing
                      output data.
-------------------------------------------------


-------------------------------------------------
How to run the model?
1) Change direction to kuo_ooyama_bk.
2) Type "run" in the terminal and the model will 
   begin to compile and integrate.

ps. The execution file 'run':

      pgf77 -r8 main.f cfftlib.f -o reconv
      reconv
      rm -rf reconv *.o


3) During the integration process,
   you will see the values of 8 variables
   (entropy, dry air density, moist density, 
    u, w, temperature, pressure) 
   on both grids (16,16) and (22,22).

Note: The model default will use DOUBLE PRECISION 
to integrate, which can be changed in the "run" file.
-------------------------------------------------


-------------------------------------------------
How to change the resolution of the model?
The control of model resolution is at the first line in c2o.f
mx and mz represent the wave number truncation in both directions.
The grid points required are nx=mx/3*2 and nz=mz/3*2 respectively.
For example:
if mx=48, mz=48, then the model will truncate at wave number 32
in both directions, and the output is on the 'regular' grid points 32 by 32.

                  !!!!! Important !!!!!
If you increase the resolution of the model,
remember also to decrease the time step (delt)
to fit the CFL criteria according to the 
explicit time integration scheme -- RK4.
-------------------------------------------------


-------------------------------------------------
How to handle the output data?
The output data named *_asc.dat is the ascii file,
so you could directly open it to see the value on each grid.
The matlab drawing program is located in 
plot_program. Download all the .dat files to your
pc and open matlab to draw the model outputs.

                                                



                                                 Enjoy ~~
